# Self-Balancing IoT Robot
A high-performance, two-wheeled inverted pendulum robot designed for real-time stability and wireless calibration.

## 🚀 Overview
This project implements a closed-loop **PID control system** to maintain upright balance. By fusing accelerometer and gyroscope data through a **Kalman Filter**, the robot achieves precise tilt-angle estimation and smooth motor response.
